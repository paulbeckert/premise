EXTRACT
=======

The EXTRACT phase consists of the following steps:

* extraction and cleaning of the ecoinvent database
* import and cleaning of additional inventories
* import and cleaning of user-provided inventories (optional)
* loading of IAM data

Supported versions of ecoinvent
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*premise* currently works with the following ecoinvent database versions:

* v.3.5, cut-off
* v.3.6, cut-off
* v.3.7, cut-off
* v.3.7.1, cut-off
* v.3.8, cut-off

Work is being carried out to develop compatibility with the *consequential*
version of the ecoinvent database.

Supported sources of ecoinvent
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

*premise* can extract the ecoinvent database from:

* a brightway2_ project that contains the ecoinvent database
* ecosposld2 files, that can be downloaded from the ecoinvent_ website

.. _ecoinvent: https://ecoinvent.org
.. _brightway2: https://brightway.dev/



From a brightway2 project
-------------------------

To extract from an ecoinvent database located in a brightway2 project, simply
indicate the database name in `source_db` and its version in `source_version`:

.. code-block:: python

  from premise import *
  import brightway2 as bw

  bw.projects.set_current("my_project)

  ndb = NewDatabase(
        scenarios=[
                {"model":"remind", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2028}
            ],
        source_db="ecoinvent 3.7 cutoff", # <-- this is NEW.
        source_version="3.7.1", # <-- this is NEW
        key='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    )

Note that a cache of the database will be created the first time and
store in the library folder. Any subsequent creation of databases
using the same ecoinvent version will no longer require this extraction
step.

If you wish to clear that cache folder, do:

.. code-block:: python

    from premise import *

    clear_cache()

From ecospold2 files
--------------------

To extract from a set of ecospold2 files, you need to point to the location of those files
in `source_file_path`, as well as indicate the database format in `source_type`:

.. code-block:: python

    from premise import *

    ndb = NewDatabase(
        scenarios = [
            {"model":"remind", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2028}
                    ],
        source_type="ecospold", # <--- this is NEW
        source_file_path=r"C:\file\path\to\ecoinvent 3.5_cutoff_ecoSpold02\datasets", # <-- this is NEW
        source_version="3.5",
    )

Import of additional inventories
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

After the ecoinvent database is extracted and checked, a number of additional invenotries
are imported, regardless of the year of scenario that is being considered.


Power generation
----------------

A number of  datasets relating to power generation not originally present in
ecoinvent are imported. The next sub-sections lists such datasets.

Power plants with CCS
*********************

Datasets for power generation with Carbon Capture and Storage are imported.
They originate from Volkart_ et al. 2013, and can be consulted here: LCI_Power_generation_.
An exception to this are the inventories for biomass-based integrated gasification combined cycle power plants,
which are from Briones-Hidrovo_ et al, 2020.

.. _Volkart: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijggc.2013.03.003

Natural gas
***********

Updated inventories relating to natural gas extraction and distribution
are imported to substitute some of the original ecoinvent dataset.
These datasets originate from ESU Services and come with a report_,
and can be consulted here: LCI_Oil_NG_.

.. _LCI_Oil_NG: https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-ESU-oil-and-gas.xlsx

They have been adapted to a brightway2-compatible format.
These new inventories have, among other things, higher methane slip
emissions along the natural gas supply chain, especially at extraction.

.. _report: http://www.esu-services.ch/fileadmin/download/publicLCI/meili-2021-LCI%20for%20the%20oil%20and%20gas%20extraction.pdf

The original natural gas datasets are preserved, but they do not provide input to any
other datasets in the database. The new datasets provide natural gas at high pressure to
the original supply chains, which remain unchanged.

In the report, the generation potential per installation type is multiplied by the number of installations
in each country, to produce country-specific PV power mix datasets normalized to 1 kWh.
The report specifies the production-weighted PV mix for each country, but we further split it
between residential (<=3kWp) and commercial (>3kWp) installations
(as most IAMs make such distinction):

Hydrogen storage and distribution
*********************************

A number of datasets relating to hydrogen storage and distribution are also imported.

They are necessary to model the distribution of hydrogen:

* via re-assigned transmission and distribution CNG pipelines, in a gaseous state
* via dedicated transmission and distribution hydrogen pipelines, in a gaseous state
* as a liquid organic compound, by hydrogenation
* via truck, in a liquid state
* hydrogen refuelling station


Small and large storage solutions are also provided:
* high pressure hydrogen storage tank
* geological storage tank

These datasets originate from the work of Wulf_ et al. 2018, and can be
consulted here: LCI_H2_distr_. For re-assigned CNG pipelines, which require the hydrogen
to be mixed together with oxygen to limit metal embrittlement,
some parameters are taken from the work of Cerniauskas_ et al. 2020.

The datasets introduced are listed in the table below.

Biofuels
--------

Inventories for energy crops- and residues-based production of bioethanol and biodiesel
are imported, and can be consulted here: LCI_biofuels_. They include the farming of the crop,
the conversion of hte biomass to fuel, as well as its distribution. The conversion process
often leads to the production of co-products (dried distiller's grain, electricity, CO2, bagasse.).
Hence, energy, economic and system expansion partitioning approaches are available.
These inventories originate from several different sources
(Wu_ et al. 2006 (2020 update), Cozzolino_ 2018, Pereira_ et al. 2019 and Gonzalez-Garcia_ et al. 2012),
indicated in the table below.

  shift process) to produce syncrude, which is cracked into diesel, kerosene,
  naphtha and lubricating oil. Inventories are from van der Giesen_ et al. 2014.
* *Methanol-to-liquids*: methanol is synthesized from hydrogen and CO2, and further
  distilled into gasoline, diesel, LGP and kerosene. Synthetic methanol inventories
  are from Hank_ et al. 2019. The methanol to fuel process specifications are from
  FVV_ 2013.
* *Electro-chemical methanation*: methane is produced from hydrogen and CO2 using
  a Sabatier methanation reactor. Inventories are from Zhang_ et al, 2019.

In their default configuration, these fuels use hydrogen from electrolysis and CO2
from direct air capture (DAC). However, *premise* builds different configurations
(i.e., CO2 and hydrogen sources) for these fuels, for each IAM region:

Direct Air Capture
------------------

Inventories for direct air capture of CO2 using ClimeWork's low-temperature
process are imported. They originate from the work of Terlouw_ et al. 2021.
They can be consulted here: LCI_DAC_.

.. _Terlouw: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c03263
.. _LCI_DAC: https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-direct-air-capture.xlsx

They introduce the following datasets:


 ================================================================================== ===========

In its default configuration, the DAC process uses "free of burden" excess heat
and grid-supplied electricity. *premise* creates various configurations of that
same process, using different sources for heat (industrial steam heat, heat
pump heat), which are found under the following names, for each IAM region:

Li-ion batteries
----------------

NMC-111, NMC-6222 NMC-811 and NCA Lithium-ion battery inventories are originally
from Dai_ et al. 2019. They have been adapted to ecoinvent by Crenna_ et al, 2021.
LFP and LTO Lithium-ion battery inventories are from  Schmidt_ et al. 2019.
Additionally, *premise* uses new inventories for natural graphite, from Engels_
et al. 2022, to partly replace the synthetic graphite used in Dai's inventories,
to represent a 50:50 split between natural and synthetic graphite.
These inventories can be found here: LCI_batteries_.

These battery inventories are mostly used by battery electric vehicles
(also imported by *premise*), and are to be preferred to battery
inventories coming with ecoinvent.


Road vehicles
-------------

*premise* imports inventories for different types of on-road vehicles.

Two-wheelers
************

The following datasets for two-wheelers are imported.
Inventories are from Sacchi_ et al. 2022. The vehicles are available
for different years and emission standards. *premise* will only
import vehicles which production year is equal or inferior to
the scenario year considered. The inventories can be consulted
here: LCItwowheelers_.

Inventories are from Sacchi2_ et al. 2022 (in review). The vehicles are available
for different years and emission standards and for each IAM region. *premise* will only
import vehicles which production year is equal or inferior to
the scenario year considered. *premise* will create fleet average vehicles
during the *Transport* transformation for each IAM region. The inventories can be consulted
here: LCIpasscars_.

 =================================================================================================================== ==================

Inventories are from Sacchi_ et al. 2021. The vehicles are available
for different years and emission standards and for each IAM region. *premise* will only
import vehicles which production year is equal or inferior to
the scenario year considered. *premise* will create fleet average vehicles
during the *Transport* transformation for each IAM region. The inventories can be consulted
here: LCIbuses_.

.. _LCIbuses: https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/lci-buses.xlsx

At the moment. these inventories do not supply inputs to other activities in the LCI database.
As such, they are optional.

They can be excluded upon database creation by specifying it in
`exclude`, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    ndb = NewDatabase(
                scenarios=[
                    {"model":"image", "pathway":"SSP2-Base", "year":2029, "exclude": ["update_buses"]}
                ],
                source_db="ecoinvent 3.8 cutoff",
                source_version="3.8",
                key='xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
    )

Migration between ecoinvent versions
------------------------------------

Because the additional inventories that are imported may be composed
of exchanges meant to link with an ecoinvent version different
than what the user specifies to *premise* upon the database creation,
it is necessary to be able to "translate" the imported inventories
so that they correctly link to any ecoinvent version *premise* is
compatible with.

Therefore, *premise* has a migration map that is used to convert
certain exchanges to be compatible with a given ecoinvent version.

This migration map is provided here: migrationmap_.

.. _migrationmap: https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/premise/data/additional_inventories/migration_map.csv

IAM data collection
"""""""""""""""""""

After extracting the ecoinvent database and additional inventories,
*premise* instantiates the class *IAMDataCollection*, which collects
all sorts of data from the IAM output file and store it into
multi-dimensional arrays.


Production volumes
------------------

Production volumes for different commodities are collected, for the
year and scenario specified by the user. Production volumes are used to
build regional markets. For example, for the global market, the volume-based
shares of each region are used to reflect their respective supply importance.
Another example is for building electricity markets: the respective
production volumes of each electricity-producing technology is used to
determine the gross supply mix of the market.


The table below shows the correspondence between *premise*, REMIND, IMAGE
and LCI terminology, regarding electricity producing technologies. *premise*
production volumes given for secondary energy carriers for electricity.
The mapping file is available in the library root folder: mappingElec_.

.. note::

    IAMs do not necessarily display the same variety of technologies.
    For example, REMIND does not provide a variable for residential PV production.


.. note::

    Because of a lack of more diverse inventories, wind power is only represented
    with relatively small installations (< 1MW, 1-3 MW and >3 MW), in respect to today's
    standard. This can lead to overestimate the associated environmental burden.

.. note::

    **Modelling choice**: *premise* builds several potential supply chains for hydrogen.
    Because the logistics to supply hydrogen in the future is not known or indicated by the IAM,
    the choice is made to supply it by truck over 500 km, in a gaseous state.

Efficiencies
------------

The efficiency of the different technologies producing
commodities (e.g., electricity, steel, cement, fuel) is modelled to change over time
by the IAM. *premise* stores the relative change in efficiency of such technologies.

*premise* stores the change in efficiency (called *scaling factor*) of a given technology
relative to 2020. This is based on the fact that the efficiency of ecoinvent datasets
are believed to reflect current (2020) efficiency.

.. note::

    If a technology, in a given region, is given a *scaling factor* of 1.2 in 2030,
    this means that the corresponding ecoinvent dataset is adjusted so that its
    efficiency is improved by 20% (by multiplying the dataset inputs by 1/1.2).
    In other words, *premise* does not use the efficiency given by the IAM,
    but rather its change over time relative to 2020.

The *scaling factors* considered for a given scenario can be consulted, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    ndb.scenarios[0]["iam data"].efficiency

Land use and land use change
----------------------------

When building prospective databases using the IAM IMAGE model, the latter provides
additional variables relating to average *land use* and *land use change* emissions, for each type of
crop grown to be used in biofuel production.
Upon the creation of biofuel supply chains in the *Fuels* transformation function, such information
is used to adjust the inventories of crop farming datasets. The table below shows the IMAGE variables
used to that effect. The mapping file is
available in the library root folder: mappingCrops_.

Carbon Capture and Storage
--------------------------

Some scenarios involve the capture and storage of CO2 emissions
of certain sectors (e.g., cement and steel).
The capture rate of a given sector is calculated
from the IAM data file, as::

    rate = amount of CO2 captured / (amount of CO2 captured + amount of CO2 not captured)

The table below lists the variables needed to calculate those rates.

 ============================== =============================== ============================================
  name in premise                name in REMIND                  name in IMAGE
 ============================== =============================== ============================================
  cement - CO2 (not captured)    Emi|CO2|FFaI|Industry|Cement    Emissions|CO2|Industry|Cement|Gross
  cement - CCO2 (captured)       Emi|CCO2|FFaI|Industry|Cement   Emissions|CO2|Industry|Cement|Sequestered
  steel - CO2 (not captured)     Emi|CO2|FFaI|Industry|Steel     Emissions|CO2|Industry|Steel|Gross
  steel - CCO2 (captured)        Emi|CCO2|FFaI|Industry|Steel    Emissions|CO2|Industry|Steel|Sequestered
 ============================== =============================== ============================================


The *carbon capture rates* which are floating values
comprised between 0 and 1, can be consulted like so:

.. code-block:: python

    ndb.scenarios[0]["iam data"].carbon_capture_rate


Data sources external to the IAM
--------------------------------

*premise* tries to adhere to the IAM scenario data as much as possible. There are
however a number of cases where external data sources are used. This is notably the case
for non-CO2 pollutants emissions for different sectors (electricity, steel and cement),
fuel mixes and power generation for the cement industry, as well as expected efficiency gains
for photovoltaic panels.

Air emissions
*************

*premise* relies on projections from the air emissions model GAINS_
to adjust the emissions of pollutants for different sectors.
As with efficiencies, *premise* stores the change in emissions (called *scaling factor*)
of a given technology relative to 2020. This is based on the fact that the emissions of
ecoinvent datasets are believed to reflect the current (2020) situation.
Hence, if a technology, in a given region, has a *scaling factor* of 1.2 in 2030,
this means that the corresponding ecoinvent dataset is adjusted so that its emissions
of a given substance is improved by 20%. In other words, *premise* does not use
the emissions level given by GAINS, but rather its change over time relative to 2020.

.. _GAINS: https://gains.iiasa.ac.at/models/


The equivalence between the technology terminology in *premise* and GAINS
are shown in the table below.

Cement production
*****************

A number of parameters to model future clinker/cement production is not sourced from the
IAM file, but from data from the GCCA_ database "Getting the Numbers Right", as well as
from the IEA_ roadmap report for the cement industry.

.. _GCCA: https://gccassociation.org/sustainability-innovation/gnr-gcca-in-numbers/
.. _IEA: https://www.wbcsd.org/contentwbc/download/4586/61682/1

These two sources are combined and used to derive the following parameters:

* share of kiln technology (wet, dry, wet with pre-heater, etc.)
* fuel mix
* heat recovery rate
* electricity use

This data is available here: GNRdata_.

The expected change in fuel efficiency is based on IAM scenario projections.

Photovoltaic panels
*******************

Module efficiencies in 2010 for micro-Si and single-Si are from IEA_ Task 12
report. For multi-Si, CIGS, CIS and CdTe, they are from IEA2_ road map report
on PV panels.

.. _IEA2: https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/3a99654f-ffff-469f-b83c-bf0386ed8537/pv_roadmap.pdf

Current (2020) module efficiencies for all PV types are given by a 2021 report
from the Fraunhofer_ Institute.

The efficiencies indicated for 2050 are what has been obtained in laboratory
conditions by the Fraunhofer_ Institute. In other words, it is assumed that by 2050,
solar PVs will reach production level efficiencies equal to those observed today
in laboratories.
